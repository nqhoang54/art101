                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>What debugging tools did you use? How did you use them? </p>
                <p>What we decided to debug for this lab was <a href="lab8/index.html">Lab 8 Anon Functions and Callbacks</a> specifically task X. The goal of task X was to print
                    the output of the function. Well long story short it wasn't working. We used the console.log() if it was working but it was working. 
                    So once we knew the fucntion was working we went to found out why the output wasn't printing. We used Wes Modes AI to help us debug the code. Which led to 
                    the conclusion that the output was not printing because the output was not being appended to the div, concatenating erorrs, and syntax errors.
